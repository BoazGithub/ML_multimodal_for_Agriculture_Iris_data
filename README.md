# ML_multimodal_for_Agriculture_Iris_data
This project compares various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM) on the IRIS dataset. Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/Precision-Recall curves. It demonstrates multi-class evaluation and visualization using Python libraries.
