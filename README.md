# ML_multimodal_for_Agriculture_Iris_data
This project compares various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM) on the IRIS dataset. Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC/Precision-Recall curves. It demonstrates multi-class evaluation and visualization using Python libraries.
# Iris_data Agricultural dataset description
The Iris dataset isn't agricultural; it's a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics often used to test classification algorithms. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) to distinguish between them based on flower morphology. The dataset includes 150 samples with four features:

1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)

Each sample is labeled with its species, making it ideal for testing classification models due to its simplicity and balanced class distribution. Although not directly related to agriculture, it serves as a foundational dataset for exploring data analysis, feature relationships, and predictive modeling, which can also be applied to agricultural datasets in similar contexts.
